# HTTPC - HTTP Method Tester Tool


**HTTPC** is a lightweight and efficient Go-based utility designed to test various HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) against a list of URLs. It is perfect for security researchers, developers, and system administrators who want to quickly identify which HTTP methods are supported by a server.

---

## Features

- **Multiple HTTP Methods**: Test a wide range of HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT).
- **Concurrency**: Test multiple URLs concurrently for faster results.
- **Customizable**: Set concurrency levels, timeouts, retries, and user-agent headers.
- **Status Code Filtering**: Filter results based on specific HTTP status codes.
- **Output to File**: Save results to a file for further analysis.
- **Verbose and Silent Modes**: Choose between detailed logs or silent mode for minimal output.
- **Color-Coded Output**: Easily identify results with color-coded status codes.

## Usage

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument           | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-c`               | Set concurrency level (default: `10`).                                     |
| `-timeout`         | Set request timeout (default: `5s`).                                       |
| `-retries`         | Set number of retries for failed requests (default: `1`).                  |
| `-ua`              | Set custom User-Agent header (default: `Go-HTTP-Client/1.1`).              |
| `-silent`          | Enable silent mode (only output results).                                  |
| `-v`               | Enable verbose mode for detailed logs.                                     |
| `-o`               | Save results to a file (e.g., `results.txt`).                              |
| `-m`               | Comma-separated HTTP methods to test (default: all methods).               |
| `-url`             | Test a single URL.                                                         |
| `-status`          | Comma-separated status codes to filter (e.g., `200,404`).                  |

### Examples

1. **Test a Single URL**:
   ```bash
   ./httpc -url https://example.com
   ```

2. **Test Multiple URLs from stdin**:
   ```bash
   cat urls.txt | ./httpc
   ```

3. **Test Specific HTTP Methods**:
   ```bash
   ./httpc -url https://example.com -m "GET,POST,PUT"
   ```

4. **Filter by Status Codes**:
   ```bash
   ./httpc -url https://example.com -status "200,404"
   ```

5. **Save Results to a File**:
   ```bash
   ./httpc -url https://example.com -o results.txt
   ```

6. **Increase Concurrency**:
   ```bash
   ./httpc -url https://example.com -c 20
   ```
